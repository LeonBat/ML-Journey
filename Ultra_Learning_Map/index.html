                    Machine Learning is a field I expect to grow in importance in the age of AI.
                    With this project, I want to understand the fundamentals and the concepts behind it.
                    It also serves as a good foundation for AI in general and allows me to improve my ML engineering
                    skills.

                    I will follow the principles of ultra-learning as described by Scott Young in his book
                    "Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career".
                    This includes self-directed learning, focusing on high-impact projects, and continuous practice
                    and feedback.
